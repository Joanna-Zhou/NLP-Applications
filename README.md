## Overview

This repository features a collection of NLP projects, each designed to explore and implement different techniques in natural language processing. Through these projects, I have developed optimized solutions for various text processing challenges, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.

## Tools

- **Python**: Primary language for developing NLP algorithms.
- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face).
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for visual analysis.

## Projects

Here are some of the main projects included in this repository:

1. **Transformer**
   - Files: `A2/code/a2_encoder_decoder.py`

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Performed sentiment analysis on social media data.
   - Files: `A1/code/Submissions/a1_classify.py`

3. **Language Modeling**
   - Built and fine-tuned language models for text generation.
   - Files: `A3/submission/a3_gmm.py`

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Applied text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization techniques.
   - Files: `A1/code/code0115/a1_preproc.py`, `A1/code/Submissions/a1_extractFeatures.py`
