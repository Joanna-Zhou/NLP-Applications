Well older than that, I'm just baneposting.

Bad MAGAbot!
how old is the video?  Has it been around for a long time?
You know what they say!

    "When all else fails, go on their subreddit &amp; downvote all of the comments to show them our feelings &amp; hide the truth!"
I'm not even really convinced he lied to Pence, versus was asked to lie to the public to downplay the Russia propaganda.  But as the facts now don't align with the official story, someone had to fall on their sword.  OR... there is something more going on here behind the scenes.   At face value, this seems like something they could have weathered.
Oh it takes that long for EO to be made/reviewed?
can someone explain to me what I'm looking at? Is it some kind of cage with glass that hes poking with a broom??
Citizens are protected even if they are accidentally recorded.  The DoJ took action against Flynn and this is ILLEGAL. Many felonies were committed.  Only a legal order from a judge would have made this okay. 
The Intelligence community is one of the largest components of the military industrial complex. 

They help make wars happen. 
This is what Saracen thinks about democracy.

Out out out.  You know I would say something nice about Muslims, but every Muslim I've been friends with fucked me over.  Taqqiya is why I can never take any Muslim at their word.

A racist!  A racist!  A racist!  We've got a racist!  A racist!

We have found a racist, might we burn him?

Burn him!  Burn!

How do you know he is a racist?

He looks like one.

I'm not a racist, I'm not a racist!

But you are dressed as one.

They dressed me up like this. And this isn't my hood, it's a pillow case.

What makes you think he is a racist?

He called me a dirty Jew!

A dirty Jew?

It got better.

Burn him anyway! Burn him! Burn him!

Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether he is a racist.

There are? What are they? Do they hurt?

Tell me, what colour are racists?

White!

And what's white apart from racists?

More racists!

Paper!

So why are racists white?

Because... they're... made of paper?

So how do we tell whether he's made of paper. 

Write on him! 

Ah, but can you not also write on a chalk board?

Oh yeah.

Does paper sink or float in water?

No, no, it floats. Throw him into the pond!

What else floats in water?

A duck!

Exactly, so logically, if he weights the same as a duck, he's made of paper...

And therefore?

A racist, a racist!

Well Russia did help with the DNCs promise for transparency...
Declassifying files is not treason. LOL. Leaking classified info, which the CIA did, is.
Wow, it's like T_D on the dark side of the mirror. As I type this, MSNBC at work is like, "Nvm the Flynn leaks and attempted Deep State coup in progress, let's talk about muh Russians."

Interesting 
Did you make your name and post this ironically, cuz y'know... The Robstown Cotton Pickers?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robstown_High_School


&gt; The Robstown Cottonpickers compete in the following sports: Cross Country, Volleyball, Football, Basketball, Powerlifting, Golf, Tennis, Track, Softball &amp; Baseball


I agree. CNN is pushing things so far into ridiculousness that they are actually creating an environment that is forcing people to wake up and realize they are being manipulated.
Yep, something in that post triggered it.
So... here is where it gets interesting. If they were recording only Flynn's calls, yes, that is a big no no. However, if they were recording only say, the Russian Ambassador's calls, and he happened to call Flynn and the conversation was recorded... this would in theory be okay as I understand it. In other words, if Flynn got scooped up because he was talking to someone who was being wiretapped, it is okay, but if Flynn was being wiretapped and happened to be called/call foreign agents, that is not okay. 

However, regardless there is no excuse whatsoever for this to be leaked to the media. We are in a situation where the intelligence agencies are literally selecting winners and losers based off of leaking intelligence to the media. This is a form of tyranny. This is a Manning level betrayal by the intelligence community as far as I am concerned, and should be prosecuted as treason.
Yu-gi-oh requires at least some semblance of strategy. These people haven't progressed past Go Fish.
Damn...tell us how you really feel, bro :)
What is Vault 7 I keep hearing about?
Tucker was on point and beat the living hell out this Cuck. He just shut his ass down. 

Tucker called him a political hack... Praise KEK. 

The Cuck probably went home and cried to his wife and her boyfriend about it. 
Thanks for the good read.
Bullshit. You want Trump to let the media tear him apart with no resistance. Not going to happen.
I can't stand Wapo but if they did have 9 sources on this then that is really troubling. That would be more than just Obama holdovers and includes career agents as well I would think. 
You're the one that has to prove the point you made, which you have failed miserably lol

People in the public eye are fair game as far as I'm concerned. It's just a juxtaposition of two couples.

I've never really been a follower of pewdiepie or Sargon, but Sargon's video on pewdiepie couldn't be more spot-on.  It's about free thought being shut-down by corporations.  Youtube itself represents a resistance to the MSM and will actively shut down people who they disagree with.

Using someone else's money be a minor side effect.  The major benefit would be that all of those people, even if they only gave a dollar, would be more emotionally invested in the outcome of the case.

The US dollar's value depends solely on the demand for it (like anything). Right now, in order to buy oil from OPEC countries, you must first get dollars. Since oil from these nations is in such high demand, the dollar is in high demand. This is what gives the dollar its value. It is more or less, BACKED BY OIL (instead of gold, etc). This will also show you, that if demand for oil ever falls, the dollar will fall. If demand for oil goes to zero (we completely move to renewables), the dollar will collapse! 

This explains everything going on in the word right now. If Europe, China start getting oil from places where the dollar isn't necessary for the transaction (Russia), then the dollar will weaken!

Think of it like this, if in order to buy food, you had to first obtain something wordless like bottle caps. This would make the value of bottle caps skyrocket. This is exactly what is occurring in the world right now. The US dominates economically solely because of the worlds dependence on the dollar to buy the oil they need!

similar voice and accent, but this isn't proof it was him. it points us in that direction and is worth it to investigate whether it's him or not, but we can't say for certain whose voice that is even if we think we know. 

i'm not saying it's not him, but there's not enough evidence to say that it is. we still can't rule out that it might be someone else or even fake. 

if there was some way to verify when and where the original video was created, to verify podesta's whereabouts on that date at that time, and get a statement from the person who recorded it, then we'd have something useful to build upon. without any other tangible facts, this video is shocking and upsetting and deserves investigation but really doesn't amount to evidence unless a case is built around it.  
We need to be very careful with this. I'm sure people have already said this, but there are powerful people doing everything they can to discredit and bury this story. I am suspect of these videos because they seem too convenient. No actual video of the child to avoid CP which would make it way more difficult to distribute online and narrow the audience. "John" and "skippy" are both mentioned which seems too perfect. If it was blackmail, why is there no direct evidence linking the videos to a person in power? Who makes a torture video and doesn't record the actual torture? If you didn't intend on the video being released, why would you conceal your identity and only offer breadcrumbs? The whole thing just seems to organized and not raw enough for it to be real. I think it's definitely worth researching but this topic needs healthy skepticism to avoid being discredited.

Libs are freaking out over that tweet as well. They are in a full fledged manic state right now. It's funny.
The article is factual however written as to make you feel like what they did was illegal when in fact no wrong doing was found. 
**WEW LAD**
guys... I'm scared... this shit goes too deep and was probably approved by very higher-ups in the deep state.  maybe revenge for what they consider Comey's influence in the election in favor of Trump?  You know for a fact Democrats can be petty as shit.

I am glad they are moving quickly, pretty amazing really. They didn't just suddenly discover these thousands of child trafficking criminals existed in the last month either, they just haven't been able to actually enforce the law for 8 fucking years! Fuck you Obama.

I've heard 30-35 million being closer to reality. There's a looooooooot of anchor babies and they aren't just from the South. Even people from Asia come to US and anchor themselves. 
Why? Your mom makes visits so I dont have to leave ;)
I was about to say the same thing. It's like those twitter bots that reply to every tweet Trump makes  
Well duh, now I want to delete my post.  My only defense, is I have brain drain from dealing with a couple of tards at my office.
Or like turds out of Hillary's diaper?
In an ideal world, sure. But realistically we just have to make them an even greater electoral minority. Over time we will continue to shrink the democrat's core base to the major coastal cities until they have little to no influence. Hopefully they'll be replaced by another, more sensible party.

Another sjw story at espn involves one of their tennis announcers who was axed recently. he used the term "guerrilla" to describe the tennis player and her style of play (very aggressive). the dude got fired because of fucking social justice backlash thinking he called that tennis player an ape.

You aren't crazy, there's so many "coincidences" surrounding this whole Italian pie fence conspiracy you're crazy to deny anything sketchy is going on.

Maybe I'm just getting old but I tried watching his "let's play" videos years ago and his voice was like nails on a chalkboard to me - I just couldn't understand his appeal back then.  I'll have to give him another try I guess.

hurr durr gasoline manly! I drive big truck!

Pathetic article imo.

Electric cars are the future whether you like it or not. I'll probably never own one in my lifetime, would I like one? Sure they're pretty cool, I couldn't care less about emissions but I like new technology, though if I did ever have the chance to buy one, it wouldn't be a shitty Chevy.

Im not interested in watching this shit if it isn't 100% proof its podesta. Have you watched all of them ?
I really like this idea. Be sure to include sources as well in your rebuttals for easy copy+paste. Could help some of the less invested Trump supporters red pill some people.

Suggestion: Add some bullets to your paragraphs to make it quicker and easier to read.
People in Hollywood have known about Dan Schneider being a pedo for years, and some people have known specifically about her abortion. Also, her mental instability and her symptoms are pretty much textbook for someone who's been a victim of severe childhood trauma. Also, read her tweets and see the picture of her driver's license she posted.
&gt; Nobody forgets, believe me. Especially the Iraqi vets. Check out the oathkeepers.

Yeah we need to go after Bush real hard.

But Obama, Clinton, and Bush are just puppets. We have to go after their masters as well.
Pretty cool 
he seems cool?
