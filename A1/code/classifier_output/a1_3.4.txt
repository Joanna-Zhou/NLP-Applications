The selected (No.5) classifier is obviously better - it has the highest accuracy in every single fold!
In terms of how significantly better it is, a smaller p-value means more "significantly" - that is, No.5 is much better than No.2 (which is also reflected in the poor accuracies that No.2 had), better than No.1&3 as well, and perhaps less significant compared to No.4.
