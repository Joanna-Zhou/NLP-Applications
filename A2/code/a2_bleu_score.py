def grouper(seq, n):
    '''Extract all n-grams from a sequence

    An n-gram is a contiguous sub-sequence within `seq` of length `n`. This
    function extracts them (in order) from `seq`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : sequence
        A sequence of words or token ids representing a transcription.
    n : int
        The size of sub-sequence to extract.

    Returns
    -------
    ngrams : list

    ngrams = []
    for i in range(len(seq) - n):
        ngrams.append(seq[i: i + n])

def n_gram_precision(reference, candidate, n):
    '''Calculate the precision for a given order of n-gram

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)
    n : int
        The order of n-gram precision to calculate

    Returns
    -------
    p_n : float
        The n-gram precision. In the case that the candidate has length 0,
        `p_n` is 0.

def brevity_penalty(reference, candidate):
    '''Calculate the brevity penalty between a reference and candidate

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)

    Returns
    -------
    BP : float
        The brevity penalty. In the case that the candidate transcription is
        of 0 length, `BP` is 0.

def BLEU_score(reference, hypothesis, n):
    '''Calculate the BLEU score

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)
    n : int
        The maximum order of n-gram precision to use in the calculations,
        inclusive. For example, ``n = 2`` implies both unigram and bigram
        precision will be accounted for, but not trigram.

    Returns
    -------
    bleu : float
        The BLEU score
